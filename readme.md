# Resilient Fault Tolerance w/ Polly
Virtually every application is dependent on external services, and with the rise of microservices, that number is exploding. As developers, we often focus more on the "happy path" and don't consider how our application will respond to a failure until it happens in Production. Polly is an open source (and .net foundation) project that lets you easily add resilient fault tolerance to your applications in a consistent, reusable way. 

This repo includes code samples and slide deck from my talk showing you how to get started with Polly.

## Getting Started
Checkout the Program.cs file in the PollyDemoApp folder. Uncomment any scenarios that look interesting and give it a run!

If you create any new scenarios that you think are worth adding, please let me know!
